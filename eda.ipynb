      " Where was Henry? Ah, he was standing by her, close enough to touch the small buoyant face that topped her pillared neck most like a bell-flower on its bed.\n",
      " I remember clearly, perhaps because I ought to have my wits about me for another purpose, how Sir Roland’s father, Sir Weedon, once saw Henry taking the part of Lesurques and mixed him up with Le Cirque d’Hiver.\n",
      " I always used Bisto myself, and anyway Henry, the angel, was plying his intended fifth with Emperor’s Peg---equal parts of vitriol and applejack in his case---at the top of the ruined lighthouse.\n",
      " What Hopes? I meant, did one know the family? It was really the way he took it for granted that I would rather hear him talking about Cerebos and Cerebos and Cerebos or something than attend to poor Henry that irritated me beyond endurance.\n",
      " My mistress wore them ; was it for that that I had begun to tire of her already?     If Henry had been there he could have told me what to do.\n",
      " Henry had taught me a little of his trade, and this, curiously enough, was what had struck.\n",
      " Henry was now stooping over the other body, whistling between its teeth.\n",
      " At my sign, Henry stooped and made all clean again.\n",
      " Should I make an effort and go back to Henry? He was ready to love.\n",
      "   To reckon with Henry! That was never easy.\n",
      " He pottered about with me and succeeded at last in making friends with Henry.\n",
      "   The girl had left Henry by this time, thank God.\n",
      " And again, in this very place for another reason, Henry would remember.\n",
      " I had to reckon with Henry.\n",
      " And, now I came to think of it, Henry had also gone to-day ; poor Henry, who had stayed uncomfortably after his meeting with Clément yesterday.\n",
      "   For this time being, Henry was drawing towards a close.\n",
      " Henry was always made up too.\n",
      " But it was not till my marriage with Henry that old Charles Goodfellow dared to hint that I was going gay.\n",
      " Then I remembered Henry’s favourite quotation :            But M’Cullough ‘e wanted cabins with marble                 and maple and all         And Brussels an’ Utrecht velvet, and bath and a                  Social Hall           Just broken to twine round they harp-strings, as if                 no wild beat         Were now raging to torture the desert! Then I,                 as was meet…   I assure you I had not seen her enter  but suddenly I was electrically aware that she was sitting near me.\n",
      " What could come next? I had let Henry guide me.\n",
      " Her voice purred in my quick ears ; I thought of a jaguar on a lean bough, and envied Henry.\n",
      " And this made it difficult to adequately appreciate Henry’s problem.\n",
      " But I must, I felt, at all costs get back to Henry.\n",
      " He had found a half-burned marriage certificate in the incinerator ; that was charred lines on Henry.\n",
      " What had I actually seen? I had seen Henry---surely I had heard him called so---bending innocently over an innocent corpse of his own making.\n",
      " Got me, that is a terrible conjunction of two little words ; Henry does not like it at all.\n",
      " I was developing a bit of a yen for Henry, though this was my first introduction to him.\n",
      " Henry, though a bit on the spectacular side---to fly the viscera of his third, of the old family lawyer, at his small flagstaff, a little argued the exhibitionist---was sane enough.\n",
      " But was it? Henry was in desperate case, and this other was short-sighted enough not to realise that I should care.\n",
      " I gave the huddle farewell, and forbade Henry, my peerless investigator, to pursue the matter further.\n",
      " She, at least, shows herself delightfully interested in Henry.\n",
      " Is it a foolish ecstasy to thrill when I see her long warm fingers taking off Henry’s cap and putting it on again, and trying him out on the table? My dear guest accepts a Rainbow.\n",
      " I felt that Henry was about all I could hope to cope with, or with whom, if you like, I could hope to cope.\n",
      " Henry, before our tea of anchovy toast and various hot dishes (I was never a stinter) riotously displayed himself all over me.\n",
      " Those little golden escapes, those logical thoughts, came on me like stars upon some gloomy grove, as Henry said.\n",
      " Though I was alone again, it took me a few minutes to visualise Henry’s predicament with the detached calm which it deserved.\n",
      " I couldn’t help being sorry for Henry.\n",
      " We that did nothing study but the way to love each other, with which thoughts the day rose with delight to us and with them set, must, as Henry said, learn the hateful art, how to forget.\n",
      " If it be not now, I somewhat foolishly said to Henry, who gave a slack ear to me, yet it will be.\n",
      " You might have thought it strange for me to say these things, but you never knew Henry.\n",
      " I paused to pass my tongue over the dew distilled by the red rose, the sole survivor, and made a sign which brought Henry cat-like to me over the floor.\n",
      " I put Henry’s keenness a few inches below the withered salt-cellar.\n",
      " I drove Henry home, and left him.\n",
      " What a man! Henry, I supposed, was about his business and concern, such as it was.\n",
      " I found myself thinking with a strange weakness of the poet’s lines :           But we have all bent low and low and kissed the                 quiet feet           Of the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.\n",
      " I follow his gaze and see, as Henry saw when he was at home in Woodstock, twisted trees in front of the thick-windowed little house, and a foreground of exquisitely coloured vegetation with somewhat the consistency of fur stoles : a breast of the hills under a long cloud.\n",
      " It looked, though, as if Henry had been playing about with this exhibit.\n",
      " I wondered what Henry would think of next.\n",
      " With a blush I concentrated again on Henry, and asked myself if his recent activities did or did not constitute the darbs.\n",
      " How could I concentrate? And Henry was waiting for me.\n",
      " I looked at Henry, and felt a little sick.\n",
      " I had worked for him, Henry had worked for him.\n",
      " Why should I think of Henry at this particular juncture? I have it.\n",
      " Henry, I feel it, is for the first and last time getting out of hand.\n",
      " Good-bye, Henry.\n",

      " Long she was ; but I did not linger to pay court to her.\n",
      " She accepts Lover’s Delight from me.\n",
      "   What was it I held in my fingers? Looked at in one way it could just be a kea.\n",
      " I ordered Charles to spare no expense in confecting that Sundae known as Lover’s Delight for my companion.\n",
      " No, locked in, locked in! William the Schoolman---how like an old war song!---was of that place, and, in spite of Rysbrach’s statues of the first Lord King, it was charming.\n",
      " But until he told me about it to-day, I never knew that the Great Lexicographer had tasted Lotus with him.\n",
      " Lovely, indeed, but not appropriate.\n",
      "   Looking over at the sly sideways smile which seemed to fill all the foreground opposite me, I could not help recalling old Lord Pentarry and his minion.\n",
      " He was the third dog I had had in London.\n",
